# API Contract — product repo ↔ kebi

Source of truth: the product repo's `docs/api-contract.md`. Copy to `kebi/docs/` after any changes.

This document defines the HTTP contract between the product repo (services/api) and the AI service (kebi). The product repo is the client. The AI repo is the server.

All requests come from NestJS after auth verification. kebi never receives requests directly from the frontend.

> **ADR-079 coordination note.** The place catalog tables were renamed
> `places_v2 → places` and `place_embeddings_v2 → place_embeddings`
> (ADR-079, from `places_v2` introduced in ADR-070). The kebi schema +
> code and any product-repo reference to these table names must ship in
> **one coordinated deploy**. `place_core_id` on `POST /v1/signal` is
> now documented as `places.id`.

## Connection

- Base URL loaded from the `KEBI_BASE_URL` env var
- All endpoints are prefixed with `/v1/`
- Most requests are JSON over HTTP (`Content-Type: application/json`)
- `POST /v1/chat/stream` uses Server-Sent Events (`Content-Type: text/event-stream`) — NestJS must forward the stream to the frontend without buffering

### Service-to-service auth (gateway header contract)

Every protected request **MUST** carry two headers signed by NestJS
after it has verified the Clerk session:

| Header              | Value                                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-Gateway-Token`   | The shared secret. Same value as `GATEWAY_SHARED_SECRET` in both repos. Constant-time compared.                |
| `X-Gateway-User-Id` | The Clerk subject NestJS just verified (e.g. `user_2pZ1A8KqxYbzABC123…`). Pattern `^user_[A-Za-z0-9]{20,40}$`. |

`user_id` is **no longer a body field** on any request — kebi reads
the verified subject from the header. A missing or wrong token → 401;
malformed user id → 400. The public health probe (`GET /v1/health`)
is the only route that bypasses this check.

Both repos must hold the same `GATEWAY_SHARED_SECRET` byte-for-byte;
rotate by setting the new value on both sides during the same deploy.

### Plan-tier entitlements (gateway header contract) — ADR-112

NestJS owns plans/billing; kebi owns no users or plans. The gateway forwards
the caller's **capabilities** (never the plan name) as headers on the same
trusted channel as the identity. kebi enforces them. Repricing or renaming a
tier is a gateway-only change — kebi never sees it.

| Header                              | Value          | Missing →             | Gates                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-Gateway-Taste-Enabled`           | `true`/`false` | `false` (fail closed) | Taste-model personalization on `/v1/chat`           |
| `X-Gateway-Discovery-Enabled`       | `true`/`false` | `false` (fail closed) | `suggest_places` + `discover_places` agent tools    |
| `X-Gateway-Save-Limit`              | integer        | absent = unlimited    | Max saved places (`/v1/extract`, `/v1/user/places`) |
| `X-Gateway-Consults-Per-Day`        | integer        | absent = unlimited    | Daily consult quota on `/v1/chat`(+`/stream`)       |
| `X-Gateway-Advanced-Models-Enabled` | `true`/`false` | `false` (fail closed) | Higher-quality orchestrator model on consults       |

Asymmetry by design (ADR-112): the boolean feature flags **fail closed** (a
missing header denies the paid feature); the numeric limits **fail open** to
unlimited (a missing header means no cap), so kebi never has to hard-code the
free-tier numbers. The gateway is expected to always send the limits for
capped tiers.

Enforcement outcomes the gateway should map to an upgrade prompt:

- **Consult quota** — `POST /v1/chat` returns `200` with `type:"error"`,
  `data.reason:"daily_limit_reached"`. `POST /v1/chat/stream` emits an `error`
  frame `{ "detail": "daily_limit_reached" }` then `done`. (Checked at entry —
  a maxed user spends no model cost.)
- **Save cap (button)** — `POST /v1/user/places` returns `403`
  `{ "detail": "save_limit_reached" }`. A re-tap on an already-saved place is
  idempotent and never counts against the cap, so it succeeds even at the limit.
- **Save cap (extraction)** — `POST /v1/extract` returns its terminal envelope
  with `status:"failed"`, `failure_reason:"save_limit_reached"`. Checked
  **before** the pipeline runs, so a user with a full library spends no
  extraction work; a user with room keeps the whole in-flight result.

### Per-user rate limits

Per-user buckets enforced via slowapi. Excess → HTTP 429. Buckets are
keyed by the verified `X-Gateway-User-Id`.

| Endpoint                    | Bucket      |
| --------------------------- | ----------- |
| POST /v1/chat               | 30 / minute |
| POST /v1/chat/stream        | 30 / minute |
| POST /v1/extract            | 10 / minute |
| GET /v1/home                | 30 / minute |
| GET /v1/user/intents        | 60 / minute |
| GET /v1/user/library        | 60 / minute |
| POST /v1/user/places        | 60 / minute |
| PATCH /v1/user/places/{id}  | 60 / minute |
| DELETE /v1/user/places/{id} | 60 / minute |
| POST /v1/signal             | 60 / minute |
| DELETE /v1/user/data        | 3 / hour    |

### Request-ID correlation

Every response (success or error) carries an `X-Request-Id` header
with a uuid4 hex. Error response bodies include the same id under
`request_id` so support / oncall can correlate without raw exception
text leaving the server.

## Shared Types

### `PlaceCore`

The canonical place shape (ADR-070, ADR-077; the catalog table is
`places` since ADR-079). Identity + static catalog fields only.
Extraction returns `PlaceCore` — it does **not** populate live fields
(rating, hours, popularity, business_status); those are filled in later
by the catalog read/enrichment path that backs the agent's consult-family
tools (ADR-089, ADR-090, ADR-091). There is no standalone product-facing
endpoint for catalog reads today — saved/discovered/suggested places are
returned inside chat responses as `tool_results`.

## POST /v1/chat

Unified conversational entry point (ADR-052, ADR-065). The agent is a
LangGraph turn driven by the `orchestrator` LLM role with a small
**consult-family** of internal tools — `find_saved` (the user's saved
places), `suggest_places` (LLM-named candidates validated against the
place provider), and `discover_places` (direct provider lookup for
utility intents and as a fall-through) — see ADR-089, ADR-090, ADR-091.
Each tool returns a structured `ConsultResult` that is surfaced to the
caller in `data.tool_results` so the product UI can render places
without re-parsing the agent's prose. URL submissions are redirected
to `POST /v1/extract` — the chat path never writes to `user_places`.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "message": "somewhere for cheap dinner near me",
  "location": { "lat": 13.7563, "lng": 100.5018 },
  "movement_profile": {
    "available_modes": ["walking", "transit", "motorbike"],
    "reach": "normal"
  }
}
```

(Plus the `X-Gateway-Token` + `X-Gateway-User-Id` headers — see "Service-to-service auth" above.)

`ToolResult` shape: `{ tool: "find_saved" | "suggest_places" | "discover_places", tool_call_id: string, payload: ConsultResult }`. `ConsultResult` carries `candidates` (each with `place`, `source ∈ {saved, suggested, discovered}`, optional namer `reason`), an `empty_reason` literal when no candidates were produced (e.g. `no_location`, `no_match`), and a `recommendation_id` (a per-recommendation id minted by kebi). The client echoes `recommendation_id` back when the user accepts/rejects (`POST /v1/signal`) or saves (`POST /v1/user/places`) a candidate, so the signal attributes to that recommendation.

### `error`

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "message": "Something went wrong, try again",
  "data": { "detail": "..." }
}
```

`data.detail` is an internal string for logs — safe to ignore in the UI. All downstream exceptions are caught and surfaced as `type="error"` with **HTTP 200** (not 5xx).

When the caller's daily consult quota (`X-Gateway-Consults-Per-Day`) is exhausted, the same `type="error"` shape carries a structured reason instead: `data.reason:"daily_limit_reached"` (HTTP 200). The agent does not run. Map it to an upgrade prompt — see "Plan-tier entitlements" above.

**HTTP Status Codes:**

| Code  | When                                         |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `200` | All successful responses, including `error`  |
| `400` | Malformed request body                       |
| `422` | Validation error (FastAPI auto, per ADR-023) |
| `500` | Unhandled internal error                     |

## POST /v1/chat/stream

SSE streaming variant. Emits reasoning steps as they happen, then a final message frame and a done frame. Requires the agent to be enabled.

**Request:** Identical body to `POST /v1/chat`.

**Response:** `Content-Type: text/event-stream`. Frame types, in approximately this order:

```
event: reasoning_step
data: {"id":"find_saved#0","step":"find_saved","title":"searched your saved spots","summary":null,"status":"active","source":"agent","visibility":"user","duration_ms":null}

event: reasoning_step
data: {"id":"find_saved#0","step":"find_saved.summary","title":"searched your saved spots","summary":"2 spots — Wagyu, Beef Tei","status":"done","source":"agent","visibility":"user","duration_ms":420.0}

event: tool_result
data: <ToolResult JSON>

event: message
data: {"content": "<final assistant text>"}

event: done
data: {"tool_calls_used": 1}
```

| Frame            | When emitted                                                                                       | Data shape                                                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `reasoning_step` | Twice per step over its lifecycle (see below) — the agent, every tool, and the fallback all stream | `ReasoningStep` + stream lifecycle fields (`id`, `status`) |
| `tool_result`    | Once per completed tool call this turn                                                             | `ToolResult` (tool, tool_call_id, payload)                 |
| `message`        | Once, after the graph completes, if there is text                                                  | `{"content": string}`                                      |
| `done`           | Always last — even if no message was produced                                                      | `{"tool_calls_used": integer}`                             |

**Step lifecycle (ADR-102).** Each reasoning step is emitted as **two** `reasoning_step` frames keyed by a stable `id`: an `active` frame when the step starts and a `done` frame when it finishes. The frontend upserts by `id`. On the SSE stream `ReasoningStep` carries two fields beyond the JSON-path shape, and relaxes one:

| Field         | On `active` frame       | On `done` frame               | Notes                                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | stable step id          | same `id` as the active frame | e.g. `find_saved#0`, `agent.tool_decision#0`; upsert key          |
| `status`      | `"active"`              | `"done"`                      | lifecycle marker                                                  |
| `title`       | set                     | same string                   | bold action line; known before the result, so present on `active` |
| `summary`     | `null`                  | filled                        | client shows a skeleton while `null`                              |
| `visibility`  | set                     | same value                    | must not change across a step's lifecycle (client keys on `id`)   |
| `duration_ms` | `null`                  | set                           | node latency on completion                                        |
| `source`      | `"agent" \| "fallback"` | same                          | ADR-075 narrowed this; no `"tool"` value                          |

Rules: every `done` frame is preceded by an `active` frame with the same `id`; an interrupted step (e.g. a tool that times out mid-phase) may emit `active` with no `done` (renders as a step left in its skeleton). `visibility:"debug"` steps ride the stream too — the client filters them. There is **no** "step N of M" total: the agent decides tools dynamically, so the client shows a live "step N" and a "N steps · time" meta line on completion, no greyed pending rows.

On the stream `id` is always a non-null string and `status` is always `"active"` or `"done"`. The non-stream `POST /v1/chat` omits both fields entirely (its steps are implicitly complete) — that payload is unchanged from before this feature.

On error mid-stream:

```
event: error
data: {"detail": "<error string>"}
```

If the daily consult quota is exhausted, the stream opens (HTTP 200) and immediately emits a terminal `error` frame with `{"detail": "daily_limit_reached"}` followed by `done` — no reasoning or message frames. Map it to an upgrade prompt.

| Code  | When                                |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| `200` | Streaming started successfully      |
| `400` | Agent disabled or graph unavailable |

## GET /v1/home

The home screen's opening surface (ADR-111): a short, context-aware
**greeting** plus a few tappable suggestion **chips**. Generated from the
caller's taste signal and the client-supplied local context. Each chip's
`text` is a pre-written intent — the client re-submits it to `POST /v1/chat`
on tap, so a chip is a first message, not a separate action. `user_id` is
taken from `X-Gateway-User-Id`.

The payload is Redis-cached per coarse context bucket (so most opens are a
cache hit; a taste regeneration refreshes it) and **fails open** — any
generation/cache/geocode error returns a neutral greeting + generic chips, so
the screen always renders and the call always returns `200`.

**Request:** query params only (all optional). Plus the
`X-Gateway-Token` + `X-Gateway-User-Id` headers.

| `local_time` | ISO-8601           | Device local time. Drives the daypart (morning/afternoon/evening/late_night) — the client's timezone is canonical      |

ADR-081: the extract response is unchanged. The name the place was shown as in the source post (e.g. a TikTok card title "Mirror Temple", resolver-cleaned of list numbering) is **not** returned here — it is persisted per save on `user_places.source_label` and surfaced when the user's saved places are read. Independently, a confidently-matched source label is added to the shared `place.place_name_aliases` (which feeds search); low-confidence labels stay per-user-only and never enter shared search.

ADR-074: results are cached by canonical URL — a repeat submission of the same URL by another user skips the pipeline and links the cached places to that user (~50 ms vs ~30 s).

ADR-112: if the caller's `X-Gateway-Save-Limit` is already met, extraction returns `status:"failed"`, `failure_reason:"save_limit_reached"` **before** running the pipeline (no LLM/vision/transcription spend). A user below the limit gets their whole in-flight result even if it nudges them over — the cap is a "you're full, stop" gate, not a per-place counter.

**Latency profile:** text → <1 s; caption-only URL → 2–5 s; video needing yt-dlp + Whisper + vision → 30–60 s (synchronous; show a progress indicator).

## GET /v1/user/library

The Library screen — a browsable, filterable, paged list of the caller's
saved places (`user_places ⋈ places`). This is the first standalone
product-facing catalog read; saved places were previously reachable only
inside chat `tool_results`. `user_id` is taken from `X-Gateway-User-Id`, so
a caller can only ever read **their own** library.

**Request:** query params only (all optional). Plus the
`X-Gateway-Token` + `X-Gateway-User-Id` headers.

```
GET /v1/user/library
GET /v1/user/library?category=cafe&visited=false&source=tiktok&limit=20
GET /v1/user/library?sort=name&limit=20

Filters combine with **AND**. Default order is newest-first (`saved_at`
descending); `sort=name` switches to case-insensitive alphabetical. A
`cursor` is bound to the `sort` it was issued under — replaying it under a
different `sort` is a **400**, so flipping the toggle restarts paging from
the first page (drop the `cursor`). Keep `sort` fixed across a paging run.

**Response (200):** `LibraryResponse`

`user_data` (`UserPlace`) fields: `user_place_id`, `place_id`, `approved`,
`visited`, `liked` (tri-state, may be `null`), `note`, `source`,
`source_ref` (origin URL; `null` for `manual`/`kebi`), `source_label` (the
name the place was shown as in the source post, ADR-081; `null` when it
matched the canonical name), `saved_at`, `visited_at`. `user_id` is **not**
echoed — the caller already knows who they are.

**Empty state:** a user with no saves (or no matches) returns
`{ "places": [], "next_cursor": null, "total": 0 }` — the empty-state UI is
the product's concern; the shape is guaranteed. (`total` is `0` only for a
user with no saves at all; a filtered page that matches nothing still
reports the unfiltered grand total.)

**Paging:** keyset (cursor) pagination, not offset — stable under new
saves (no skipped/duplicated rows at page boundaries) and fast at any
depth. The cursor anchors on the active sort's key plus `user_place_id`
(`saved_at` for `recent`, the case-folded place name for `name`) and
records which sort minted it; clients treat it as opaque and stop when
`next_cursor` is `null`.

## POST /v1/user/places

Save a place kebi recommended to the caller's library — the consult card's
**"save it"** action. The place already exists in the catalog (it was just
recommended), so this only links it to the caller. `user_id` is taken from
`X-Gateway-User-Id`; a caller can only ever save into **their own** library.

Saving also emits a **positive taste signal** — a _stronger_ one than a
link-share save: its own `saved_recommendation` interaction type, weighted
heavier in the taste evidence and **not** counted toward the discovery-source
distribution (kebi is not a channel the user discovers from).

**Request:** JSON body + the `X-Gateway-Token` + `X-Gateway-User-Id` headers.

```

`source` is **not** a field — the server stamps `kebi`. Unknown fields → 422.

**Response (201):** `LibraryUserData` — the created user-state, the same
shape as `user_data` in the library response (every `UserPlace` field
**except `user_id`**).

**Idempotent:** re-tapping save on an already-saved place returns **201**
with the existing save and does **not** re-emit the taste signal — saving
twice never double-trains taste.

## PATCH /v1/user/places/{user_place_id}

Update one saved place's **user-state** — the Library pills and menu actions
(been-there / liked / approved / note). `user_id` is taken from
`X-Gateway-User-Id`, so a caller can only ever mutate **their own** save;
ownership is enforced in the update itself (matched on
`(user_place_id, user_id)`).

**Request:** a partial JSON body — only the fields that changed. Plus the
`X-Gateway-Token` + `X-Gateway-User-Id` headers.

```
PATCH /v1/user/places/{user_place_id}
```

```json
{ "visited": true }
```

| Field      | Type             | Notes                                        |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `visited`  | `bool`           | Been-there flag                              |
| `liked`    | `bool \| null`   | Tri-state like. `null` returns it to neutral |
| `approved` | `bool`           | Curation flag                                |
| `note`     | `string \| null` | Free-text note. `null` clears it             |

**Partial semantics:** omitted ≠ null. An **omitted** field is left
untouched; an **explicit `null`** clears it (un-like to neutral, erase a
note). An **empty body** (`{}` or all fields omitted) is rejected with
**422** — a no-op patch is a client mistake. Unknown fields → 422. There is
no server-side `visited_at` stamping; only the flags/note above change.

**Response (200):** `LibraryUserData` — the full updated user-state, the
same shape as `user_data` in the library response (every `UserPlace` field
**except `user_id`**, which is never echoed). Returning the whole object
lets the client replace its local row wholesale.

| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `404` | No such save **or** it belongs to another user (`detail: saved_place_not_found`) — the two are indistinguishable, so it leaks nothing |
| `422` | Empty body, unknown field, or bad value type                                                                                          |

## DELETE /v1/user/places/{user_place_id}

Remove one saved place from the caller's library (swipe-to-delete / remove).
Hard-deletes the single `user_places` row; the shared catalog place and its
embeddings stay (cross-user data). `user_id` is taken from
`X-Gateway-User-Id` and enforced in the delete (matched on
`(user_place_id, user_id)`), so a caller can only ever delete **their own**
save. The taste model is not recomputed on a single removal.

**Request:** no body. The `X-Gateway-Token` + `X-Gateway-User-Id` headers.

```
DELETE /v1/user/places/{user_place_id}
```

**Response:** `204 No Content` on success (empty body).

| `404` | No such save **or** it belongs to another user (`detail: saved_place_not_found`) — indistinguishable, so it leaks nothing. A repeat delete of the same id therefore returns 404 |

## GET /v1/user/intents

The home screen's **"what you wanted"** list (ADR-110): the caller's recent
intent-bearing chat turns, played back verbatim, newest-first. Tapping a row
re-submits its `text` to `POST /v1/chat`. `user_id` is taken from
`X-Gateway-User-Id`, so a caller can only ever read **their own** intents.

Intents are persisted server-side from the chat turn when the turn actually
surfaced places **and** passes a noise gate (minimum word count, a
confirmation/ordinal stoplist, and de-duplication of an immediate repeat) — so
chit-chat and one-word replies never appear here. There is no client write
endpoint; the list is populated as a side effect of `POST /v1/chat`.

**Request:** query params only (all optional). Plus the
`X-Gateway-Token` + `X-Gateway-User-Id` headers.

```
GET /v1/user/intents
GET /v1/user/intents?limit=20
GET /v1/user/intents?limit=20&cursor=<next_cursor-from-prior-response>
```

| Param    | Type                      | Notes                                                                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `limit`  | `int` (1–100, default 20) | Max intents per page. Out-of-range → 422                                                      |
| `cursor` | `string`                  | Opaque cursor from a prior response's `next_cursor`. Omit for the first page. Malformed → 400 |

**Response (200):** `IntentsResponse`

```json
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "id": "9f1c2a3b-4d5e-6789-abcd-ef0123456789",
      "text": "coffee, quiet, nowhere i've been",
      "created_at": "2026-06-27T08:42:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "next_cursor": "eyJ0cyI6…"
}
```

| Field         | Type             | Notes                                                                                              |
| ------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `intents`     | `IntentItem[]`   | `{ id, text, created_at }`. `text` is the verbatim message; re-submit it to `POST /v1/chat` on tap |
| `next_cursor` | `string \| null` | Opaque keyset cursor. Pass it back as `?cursor=` for the next page. **`null` on the last page**    |

`created_at` is a **raw ISO-8601 instant** — relative phrasing ("yesterday,
8:42") is the client's to render, since only the client knows the user's
timezone. `user_id` is **not** echoed.

**Empty state:** a user with no recalled intents returns
`{ "intents": [], "next_cursor": null }` — the shape is guaranteed.

| Code  | When                                         |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `200` | Success (including the empty history)        |
| `400` | Malformed `cursor`                           |
| `422` | Unknown query param, or `limit` out of 1–100 |

## DELETE /v1/user/data

Hard-deletes a user's **AI-owned data**. Does NOT delete the user account — that lives in NestJS/Clerk. Called by the product repo's account-deletion flow after it deletes its own `users` / `user_settings` rows.

The path no longer carries the `user_id` segment — the target user is
the one identified by `X-Gateway-User-Id`. This guarantees a caller
can only ever wipe their own data, never another user's.

**Request:**

```
DELETE /v1/user/data
DELETE /v1/user/data?scope=chat_history
```

(Plus `X-Gateway-Token` + `X-Gateway-User-Id` headers.)

**Response (204):** Empty body.

| Param   | Type                                           | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scope` | repeated `DataScope` (`all` \| `chat_history`) | Selects what to delete. Omit to wipe everything (default). Unknown values → 422. A set containing `all` collapses to a full wipe. |

**What gets deleted (default / `scope=all`):**

1. `interactions` rows where `user_id = ?` (one DB transaction)
2. `user_memories` rows where `user_id = ?`
3. `taste_model` row for `user_id = ?`
4. `user_intents` rows where `user_id = ?` (same transaction as 1–3)
5. `user_places` rows where `user_id = ?` (same transaction as 1–4)
6. LangGraph checkpoint thread for `thread_id = user_id`
7. Any pending taste-regen task in the in-memory debouncer

`scope=chat_history` deletes the `user_intents` rows (step 4) + the checkpoint
thread + the debouncer task (steps 6–7) — the recall list is surfaced
conversation history (ADR-110), so "clear chat history" must clear it. The
other SQL tables (saves, memories, taste model) are left untouched.

> **Scope note:** the shared `places` catalog and its `embeddings` are
> **not** in the sweep — those rows are cross-user place identities, not
> this user's data. Only the per-user `user_places` link rows (the
> user's saves plus the source URLs they personally submitted) are
> user-owned and get wiped. The `recommendations` table and the v1
> `places`/`embeddings` tables were dropped by ADR-078.

**Notes:** idempotent (absent user → still 204); synchronous (sub-second at portfolio volume); hard-delete only; no per-user Redis keys to clean; trusted-upstream auth.

## POST /v1/signal

Behavioral signal endpoint (ADR-060, narrowed by ADR-076 to recommendation accept/reject only; ADR-078 made it trusted/un-validated).

**Request:**

```json
{
  "signal_type": "recommendation_accepted",
  "recommendation_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "place_core_id": "c0ffee00-1111-2222-3333-444455556666"
}
```

(Plus `X-Gateway-Token` + `X-Gateway-User-Id` headers.)

| Field               | Type     | Required | Notes                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `signal_type`       | `string` | Yes      | `"recommendation_accepted"` or `"recommendation_rejected"`                                                                               |
| `recommendation_id` | `string` | Yes      | **Trusted, not validated.** ADR-078 dropped the `recommendations` table; the id is recorded on the event, never looked up                |
| `place_core_id`     | `string` | Yes      | `places.id` of the place (ADR-077; renamed from `place_id` to disambiguate from `user_place_id` / `provider_id`). Trusted, not validated |

> `user_id` is sourced from `X-Gateway-User-Id`, not the body. A caller
> can only register signals for themselves — never poison another
> user's taste profile.

**Responses:** `202 { "status": "accepted" }`; `422` on schema errors (including an unknown `signal_type`). **No `404`** — ADR-078 removed the recommendation existence check.

## GET /v1/health

Health check. **Request:** none.

**Response (200):**

```json
{ "status": "ok", "name": "kebi", "version": "0.1.0", "db": "connected" }
```

| Field     | Type                            | Notes                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `status`  | `string`                        | Always `"ok"` when reachable             |
| `name`    | `string`                        | App name from `config/app.yaml`          |
| `version` | `string`                        | Package version; falls back to `"0.1.0"` |
| `db`      | `"connected" \| "disconnected"` | `SELECT 1` probe result                  |

Always HTTP 200 — DB outages surface via `db: "disconnected"`.

## API Contract Summary

All protected calls additionally send the `X-Gateway-Token` + `X-Gateway-User-Id` headers (see "Service-to-service auth").

## Error Handling

| Status  | Meaning                            | Product repo action                                     |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200     | Success (including `type="error"`) | Process response                                        |
| 400     | Bad request (malformed input)      | Log error, return 400 to frontend                       |
| 422     | Validation error                   | Return friendly message to frontend                     |
| 500     | AI service internal error          | Log error, return 503 to frontend with retry suggestion |
| Timeout | Service unreachable                | Return 503 with "service temporarily unavailable"       |

**Timeout policy:** 30 s HTTP client timeout for all AI calls. `POST /v1/extract` on a cold video URL can take up to ~60 s — size that path's timeout accordingly.

## Shared Configuration

**Embedding dimensions:** 1024 (Voyage 4-lite). pgvector columns are owned by this repo's Alembic migrations; NestJS never defines vector columns.

**Database tables FastAPI owns (Alembic-managed; NestJS never writes them):**

- `places` — shared place catalog (renamed from `places_v2`, ADR-079)
- `place_embeddings` — place vectors (renamed from `place_embeddings_v2`, ADR-079)
- `user_places` — per-user saved-place links (`approved` curation flag)
- `taste_model` — per-user taste profile
- `interactions` — append-only behavioral signal log
- `user_memories` — personal facts extracted from chat messages
- `user_intents` — the home "what you wanted" recall list (ADR-110); intent-bearing chat turns

> Dropped in ADR-078: v1 `places`/`embeddings` and `recommendations`.

---

## General Notes

- All protected requests carry `X-Gateway-Token` (shared HMAC secret) and `X-Gateway-User-Id` (verified Clerk subject). kebi never sees Clerk tokens directly — it trusts the gateway iff the shared secret validates and the user_id matches the expected pattern.
- FastAPI owns all AI-generated data in PostgreSQL; NestJS owns product data (users, settings). Neither writes the other's tables.
- The `places` / `place_embeddings` table rename (ADR-079) is a coordinated cross-repo change — deploy kebi and the product repo together.
- The gateway-auth contract is also a coordinated change — both repos must hold the same `GATEWAY_SHARED_SECRET` and ship together. Rotating the secret means setting the new value in both deploys.
