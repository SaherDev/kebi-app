# API Contract — product repo ↔ kebi

Source of truth: the product repo's `docs/api-contract.md`. Copy to `kebi/docs/` after any changes.

This document defines the HTTP contract between the product repo (services/api) and the AI service (kebi). The product repo is the client. The AI repo is the server.

All requests come from NestJS after auth verification. kebi never receives requests directly from the frontend.

> **ADR-079 coordination note.** The place catalog tables were renamed
> `places_v2 → places` and `place_embeddings_v2 → place_embeddings`
> (ADR-079, from `places_v2` introduced in ADR-070). The kebi schema +
> code and any product-repo reference to these table names must ship in
> **one coordinated deploy**. `place_core_id` on `POST /v1/signal` is
> now documented as `places.id`.

## Connection

- Base URL loaded from YAML config: `ai_service.base_url`
- All endpoints are prefixed with `/v1/`
- Most requests are JSON over HTTP (`Content-Type: application/json`)
- `POST /v1/chat/stream` uses Server-Sent Events (`Content-Type: text/event-stream`) — NestJS must forward the stream to the frontend without buffering

### Service-to-service auth (gateway header contract)

Every protected request **MUST** carry two headers signed by NestJS
after it has verified the Clerk session:

| Header              | Value                                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-Gateway-Token`   | The shared secret. Same value as `GATEWAY_SHARED_SECRET` in both repos. Constant-time compared.                |
| `X-Gateway-User-Id` | The Clerk subject NestJS just verified (e.g. `user_2pZ1A8KqxYbzABC123…`). Pattern `^user_[A-Za-z0-9]{20,40}$`. |

`user_id` is **no longer a body field** on any request — kebi reads
the verified subject from the header. A missing or wrong token → 401;
malformed user id → 400. The public health probe (`GET /v1/health`)
is the only route that bypasses this check.

Both repos must hold the same `GATEWAY_SHARED_SECRET` byte-for-byte;
rotate by setting the new value on both sides during the same deploy.

### Per-user rate limits

Per-user buckets enforced via slowapi. Excess → HTTP 429. Buckets are
keyed by the verified `X-Gateway-User-Id`.

| Endpoint             | Bucket      |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| POST /v1/chat        | 30 / minute |
| POST /v1/chat/stream | 30 / minute |
| POST /v1/extract     | 10 / minute |
| POST /v1/signal      | 60 / minute |
| DELETE /v1/user/data | 3 / hour    |

### Request-ID correlation

Every response (success or error) carries an `X-Request-Id` header
with a uuid4 hex. Error response bodies include the same id under
`request_id` so support / oncall can correlate without raw exception
text leaving the server.

## Shared Types

### `PlaceCore`

The canonical place shape (ADR-070, ADR-077; the catalog table is
`places` since ADR-079). Identity + static catalog fields only.
Extraction returns `PlaceCore` — it does **not** populate live fields
(rating, hours, popularity, business_status); those are filled in later
by the catalog read/enrichment path that backs the agent's consult-family
tools (ADR-089, ADR-090, ADR-091). There is no standalone product-facing
endpoint for catalog reads today — saved/discovered/suggested places are
returned inside chat responses as `tool_results`.

## POST /v1/chat

Unified conversational entry point (ADR-052, ADR-065). The agent is a
LangGraph turn driven by the `orchestrator` LLM role with a small
**consult-family** of internal tools — `find_saved` (the user's saved
places), `suggest_places` (LLM-named candidates validated against the
place provider), and `discover_places` (direct provider lookup for
utility intents and as a fall-through) — see ADR-089, ADR-090, ADR-091.
Each tool returns a structured `ConsultResult` that is surfaced to the
caller in `data.tool_results` so the product UI can render places
without re-parsing the agent's prose. URL submissions are redirected
to `POST /v1/extract` — the chat path never writes to `user_places`.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "message": "somewhere for cheap dinner near me",
  "location": { "lat": 13.7563, "lng": 100.5018 },
  "movement_profile": {
    "available_modes": ["walking", "transit", "motorbike"],
    "reach": "normal"
  }
}
```

(Plus the `X-Gateway-Token` + `X-Gateway-User-Id` headers — see "Service-to-service auth" above.)

Omitted → kebi applies a neutral fallback. The agent resolves an effective mode per turn by pairing this capability with the working location's city + density; an explicit mode word in the message still overrides.

`ToolResult` shape: `{ tool: "find_saved" | "suggest_places" | "discover_places", tool_call_id: string, payload: ConsultResult }`. `ConsultResult` carries `candidates` (each with `place`, `source ∈ {saved, suggested, discovered}`, optional namer `reason`), and an `empty_reason` literal when no candidates were produced (e.g. `no_location`, `no_match`).

### `error`

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "message": "Something went wrong, try again",
  "data": { "detail": "..." }
}
```

`data.detail` is an internal string for logs — safe to ignore in the UI. All downstream exceptions are caught and surfaced as `type="error"` with **HTTP 200** (not 5xx).

**HTTP Status Codes:**

| Code  | When                                         |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `200` | All successful responses, including `error`  |
| `400` | Malformed request body                       |
| `422` | Validation error (FastAPI auto, per ADR-023) |
| `500` | Unhandled internal error                     |

## POST /v1/chat/stream

SSE streaming variant. Emits reasoning steps as they happen, then a final message frame and a done frame. Requires the agent to be enabled.

**Request:** Identical body to `POST /v1/chat`.

**Response:** `Content-Type: text/event-stream`. Frame types, in approximately this order:

```
event: reasoning_step
data: {"id":"find_saved#0","step":"find_saved","title":"searched your saved spots","summary":null,"status":"active","source":"agent","visibility":"user","duration_ms":null}

event: reasoning_step
data: {"id":"find_saved#0","step":"find_saved.summary","title":"searched your saved spots","summary":"2 spots — Wagyu, Beef Tei","status":"done","source":"agent","visibility":"user","duration_ms":420.0}

event: tool_result
data: <ToolResult JSON>

event: message
data: {"content": "<final assistant text>"}

event: done
data: {"tool_calls_used": 1}
```

| Frame            | When emitted                                                                                       | Data shape                                                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `reasoning_step` | Twice per step over its lifecycle (see below) — the agent, every tool, and the fallback all stream | `ReasoningStep` + stream lifecycle fields (`id`, `status`) |
| `tool_result`    | Once per completed tool call this turn                                                             | `ToolResult` (tool, tool_call_id, payload)                 |
| `message`        | Once, after the graph completes, if there is text                                                  | `{"content": string}`                                      |
| `done`           | Always last — even if no message was produced                                                      | `{"tool_calls_used": integer}`                             |

**Step lifecycle (ADR-102).** Each reasoning step is emitted as **two** `reasoning_step` frames keyed by a stable `id`: an `active` frame when the step starts and a `done` frame when it finishes. The frontend upserts by `id`. On the SSE stream `ReasoningStep` carries two fields beyond the JSON-path shape, and relaxes one:

| Field         | On `active` frame       | On `done` frame               | Notes                                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | stable step id          | same `id` as the active frame | e.g. `find_saved#0`, `agent.tool_decision#0`; upsert key          |
| `status`      | `"active"`              | `"done"`                      | lifecycle marker                                                  |
| `title`       | set                     | same string                   | bold action line; known before the result, so present on `active` |
| `summary`     | `null`                  | filled                        | client shows a skeleton while `null`                              |
| `visibility`  | set                     | same value                    | must not change across a step's lifecycle (client keys on `id`)   |
| `duration_ms` | `null`                  | set                           | node latency on completion                                        |
| `source`      | `"agent" \| "fallback"` | same                          | ADR-075 narrowed this; no `"tool"` value                          |

Rules: every `done` frame is preceded by an `active` frame with the same `id`; an interrupted step (e.g. a tool that times out mid-phase) may emit `active` with no `done` (renders as a step left in its skeleton). `visibility:"debug"` steps ride the stream too — the client filters them. There is **no** "step N of M" total: the agent decides tools dynamically, so the client shows a live "step N" and a "N steps · time" meta line on completion, no greyed pending rows.

On the stream `id` is always a non-null string and `status` is always `"active"` or `"done"`. The non-stream `POST /v1/chat` omits both fields entirely (its steps are implicitly complete) — that payload is unchanged from before this feature.

On error mid-stream:

```
event: error
data: {"detail": "<error string>"}
```

| Code  | When                                |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| `200` | Streaming started successfully      |
| `400` | Agent disabled or graph unavailable |

## POST /v1/extract

Canonical product-facing extraction endpoint (ADR-073). The product repo calls this directly whenever a user submits a URL or place name to save. `/v1/chat` is conversation-only and does not write to `user_places`.

**Request:**

```json
{ "raw_input": "https://www.tiktok.com/@user/video/123" }
```

(Plus `X-Gateway-Token` + `X-Gateway-User-Id` headers.)

ADR-081: the extract response is unchanged. The name the place was shown as in the source post (e.g. a TikTok card title "Mirror Temple", resolver-cleaned of list numbering) is **not** returned here — it is persisted per save on `user_places.source_label` and surfaced when the user's saved places are read. Independently, a confidently-matched source label is added to the shared `place.place_name_aliases` (which feeds search); low-confidence labels stay per-user-only and never enter shared search.

ADR-074: results are cached by canonical URL — a repeat submission of the same URL by another user skips the pipeline and links the cached places to that user (~50 ms vs ~30 s).

**Latency profile:** text → <1 s; caption-only URL → 2–5 s; video needing yt-dlp + Whisper + vision → 30–60 s (synchronous; show a progress indicator).

## DELETE /v1/user/data

Hard-deletes a user's **AI-owned data**. Does NOT delete the user account — that lives in NestJS/Clerk. Called by the product repo's account-deletion flow after it deletes its own `users` / `user_settings` rows.

The path no longer carries the `user_id` segment — the target user is
the one identified by `X-Gateway-User-Id`. This guarantees a caller
can only ever wipe their own data, never another user's.

**Request:**

```
DELETE /v1/user/data
DELETE /v1/user/data?scope=chat_history
```

(Plus `X-Gateway-Token` + `X-Gateway-User-Id` headers.)

**Response (204):** Empty body.

| Param   | Type                                           | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scope` | repeated `DataScope` (`all` \| `chat_history`) | Selects what to delete. Omit to wipe everything (default). Unknown values → 422. A set containing `all` collapses to a full wipe. |

**What gets deleted (default / `scope=all`):**

1. `interactions` rows where `user_id = ?` (one DB transaction)
2. `user_memories` rows where `user_id = ?`
3. `taste_model` row for `user_id = ?`
4. `user_places` rows where `user_id = ?` (same transaction as 1–3)
5. LangGraph checkpoint thread for `thread_id = user_id`
6. Any pending taste-regen task in the in-memory debouncer

`scope=chat_history` performs only steps 5–6 (SQL untouched).

> **Scope note:** the shared `places` catalog and its `embeddings` are
> **not** in the sweep — those rows are cross-user place identities, not
> this user's data. Only the per-user `user_places` link rows (the
> user's saves plus the source URLs they personally submitted) are
> user-owned and get wiped. The `recommendations` table and the v1
> `places`/`embeddings` tables were dropped by ADR-078.

**Notes:** idempotent (absent user → still 204); synchronous (sub-second at portfolio volume); hard-delete only; no per-user Redis keys to clean; trusted-upstream auth.

## POST /v1/signal

Behavioral signal endpoint (ADR-060, narrowed by ADR-076 to recommendation accept/reject only; ADR-078 made it trusted/un-validated).

**Request:**

```json

| `recommendation_id` | `string` | Yes      | **Trusted, not validated.** ADR-078 dropped the `recommendations` table; the id is recorded on the event, never looked up                |
| `place_core_id`     | `string` | Yes      | `places.id` of the place (ADR-077; renamed from `place_id` to disambiguate from `user_place_id` / `provider_id`). Trusted, not validated |

> `user_id` is sourced from `X-Gateway-User-Id`, not the body. A caller
> can only register signals for themselves — never poison another
> user's taste profile.

**Responses:** `202 { "status": "accepted" }`; `422` on schema errors (including an unknown `signal_type`). **No `404`** — ADR-078 removed the recommendation existence check.

| `db`      | `"connected" \| "disconnected"` | `SELECT 1` probe result                  |

Always HTTP 200 — DB outages surface via `db: "disconnected"`.

## Error Handling

| Status  | Meaning                            | Product repo action                                     |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200     | Success (including `type="error"`) | Process response                                        |
| 400     | Bad request (malformed input)      | Log error, return 400 to frontend                       |
| 422     | Validation error                   | Return friendly message to frontend                     |
| 500     | AI service internal error          | Log error, return 503 to frontend with retry suggestion |
| Timeout | Service unreachable                | Return 503 with "service temporarily unavailable"       |

**Timeout policy:** 30 s HTTP client timeout for all AI calls. `POST /v1/extract` on a cold video URL can take up to ~60 s — size that path's timeout accordingly.

## Shared Configuration

**Embedding dimensions:** 1024 (Voyage 4-lite). pgvector columns are owned by this repo's Alembic migrations; NestJS never defines vector columns.

**Database tables FastAPI owns (Alembic-managed; NestJS never writes them):**

- `places` — shared place catalog (renamed from `places_v2`, ADR-079)
- `place_embeddings` — place vectors (renamed from `place_embeddings_v2`, ADR-079)
- `user_places` — per-user saved-place links (`approved` curation flag)
- `taste_model` — per-user taste profile
- `interactions` — append-only behavioral signal log
- `user_memories` — personal facts extracted from chat messages

> Dropped in ADR-078: v1 `places`/`embeddings` and `recommendations`.

## General Notes

- All protected requests carry `X-Gateway-Token` (shared HMAC secret) and `X-Gateway-User-Id` (verified Clerk subject). kebi never sees Clerk tokens directly — it trusts the gateway iff the shared secret validates and the user_id matches the expected pattern.
- FastAPI owns all AI-generated data in PostgreSQL; NestJS owns product data (users, settings). Neither writes the other's tables.
- The `places` / `place_embeddings` table rename (ADR-079) is a coordinated cross-repo change — deploy kebi and the product repo together.
- The gateway-auth contract is also a coordinated change — both repos must hold the same `GATEWAY_SHARED_SECRET` and ship together. Rotating the secret means setting the new value in both deploys.
